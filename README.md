# CPP-StaticSet
📝  Implementing StaticSet using C++ unordered_set lab for CS189.

This repository contains an example solution that demonstrates how to implement set operations using C++'s unordered_set standard library. It works to support various data types like integers and strings and performs set operations union, difference, intersection, map, and filter. 

## 🚀 Getting Started
Note: Compile uses g++.
1. Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/CPP-StaticSet.git
  ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd CPP-StaticSet
  ```

3. Compile:
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -o static_set main.cpp
  ```

4. Run the compiled program:
  ```bash
  ./static_set.exe
  ```
